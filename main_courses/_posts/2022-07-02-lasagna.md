ingredients:
  - 3/4 lb. lasagna noodles
  - 1 tsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
  - 2 lb. ground beef
  - 4 cloves garlic, minced
  - kosher salt
  - freshly ground black pepper
  - 32 oz marinara sauce
  - 16 oz whole milk ricotta
  - 1/2 c. freshly grated Parmesan, divided
  - 1/4 c. chopped parsley, plus more for garnish
  - 1 large egg
  - 2 lb. sliced mozzarella
instructions:
  - Preheat oven to 375ยบ. In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta according to package directions until al dente, less 2 minutes. Drain and drizzle a bit of olive oil to prevent noodles from sticking together.
  - Meanwhile, in a large pot over medium-high heat, heat oil. Cook ground beef until no longer pink, breaking up with a wooden spoon. Remove from heat and drain fat. Return beef to skillet and add garlic and oregano and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper, then add marinara and stir until warmed through.
  - Combine ricotta, 1/4 cup Parmesan, parsley, and egg in a large mixing bowl and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
  - In a large casserole dish, evenly spread a quarter of the meat sauce across the bottom of the dish, then top with a single layer of lasagna noodles, a layer of ricotta mixture, a single layer of mozzarella, and a layer of meat sauce. Repeat layers, topping the last layer of noodles with meat sauce, Parmesan, and mozzarella.
  - Cover with foil and bake for 15 minutes, then increase temperature to 400ยบ and bake uncovered for 18 to 20 minutes.
  - Garnish with parsley before serving.
