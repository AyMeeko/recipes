words_of_wisdom:
  - This all-in-one pot recipe is great for something that tastes and looks like it took a lot of time but is actually quick and easy! The recipe below will make 8 servings (side dish size) but can be enhanced with your favorite protein for a more entree feel. I frequently halve this recipe for 2-4 servings for just the two of us.
  - Because pre-shredded cheeses contain extra ingredients to prevent them from clumping together, it's highly recommended to shred your own cheese for any recipe where you want a really melty cheese. You can save yourself some time by shredding while your pasta is cooking, or add a few minutes to your prep time by shredding before you begin.
  - If you've never made mac'n'cheese using this method, it can seem a little strange the first time you put everythng together. The water/milk mixture will cook into the pasta and reduce as it goes, so it will feel both like you don't have enough liquid to cook the pasta and that you have too much liquid once it's done to make a thick, creamy, cheesy base. Follow the recipe as I've laid it out and trust yourself! It may seem runny when you first add the cheese but after fully incorporating the cheese and letting it stand to thicken, you'll have a perfect base.
ingredients:
  - 2 Tbsp butter
  - 2 Tbsp flour
  - 3 Cups water
  - 4 Cups milk
  - 1 lb uncooked pasta
  - 1 tsp Kosher salt
  - 1/2 tsp garlic powder
  - 1/4 tsp ground mustard
  - 4-5 Cups freshly-shredded sharp cheddar cheese
  - (optional) 6 oz protien (such as bacon or chicken), or your favorite mix-in
instructions:
  - Melt butter in a large pot over medium-high heat, then add flour. Whisk constantly until mixture is smooth and darkens slightly.
  - Add 1 cup water to pot and whisk constantly until mixture is smooth and begins to thicken. Gradually add remaining water and milk, alternating, until completely combined.
  - While whisking, add salt, garlic powder, and ground mustard. Add pasta and stir occassionally until it begins simmering, then reduce heat to medium-low. Cook pasta for 8-10 minutes, or until al dente, stirring frequently.
  - Once pasta is cooked, remove from heat and gradually stir in cheese. Once cheese is melted and fully incorporated, add your favorite mix-ins and season with addtional salt and pepper (to taste).
