words_of_wisdom:
   - Honestly, this recipe is the first I've encountered in a while where I have no adjustmets or advice. These are absolutely the best mashed potatoes I've ever had and it's a simple, straightforward recipe!
instructions:
  - Peel potatoes and cut into approximately same sized chunks (typically halved or quartered, depending on potato size). While preparing, place potato chunks in a bowl of cold water to reduce startch and preven discoloration.
  - Place potato chunks into a pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer.
  - Cook for 15-18 minutes or until fork tender but not falling apart.
  - When potatoes are almost finished, heat milk, butter, and smashed garlic cloves in a small sauce pan over medium heat until it begins steaming. Remove from heat and strain using small sieve to remove garlic cloves, which can be discarded. Set mixture aside.
  - Drain potatoes and place pot back over very low heat.
  - Mash potatoes immediately using hand masher or electric mixer. Drizzle in milk mixture until potatoes reach desired texture.
  - Add sour cream and salt, to taste. Garnish with chives if desired.
