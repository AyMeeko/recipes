  - 1 lb lean ground beef
  - drizzle olive oil
  - 3-4 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
  - 1 Tbsp Italian seasoning, or more to taste

  - 1/2-1 cup water 
  - 1/2 cup dry, red wine (optional)
  - 4-6 slices bacon (optional)
words_of_wisdom:
  - This is one of my own creations! It's a very basic recipe which gives you a lot of freedom to make changes to the texture or seasoning to your preference. The following are some common adaptations but feel free to get creative and make your own!
  - Ground beef can be replaced with turkey for a leaner sauce or italian beef (casing removed) for a more Italian bolognese version.
  - I personally prefer a sauce that is less chunky, but more thick. You could opt for crushed or diced tomatoes if you prefer a more chunky base, or opt for a tomato sauce if you prefer a thinner base (or add more water/wine). If you use diced tomatoes, I would recommend replacing half the amount listed for the puree with diced and the remainder crushed or sauce.
  - You can also sneak some veggies into this sauce by adding them to the ground beef after browning. Most popular options would be onions, shallots, or green peppers.
  - You may opt to use fresh herbs like basil leaves or thyme.
instructions:
  - In a large pot, add tomato puree, past, water, and wine and stir until combined. Sauce will thicken and condense the longer it is cooked, so add more water or wine as desired to thin to preference. Add Italian seasoning and crushed garlic cloves. Add lid and cook over low heat, stirring occassionally.
  - Drizzle a pre-heated skillet with olive oil over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and cook until browned. Drain. If adding veggies, do so now and cook until softened.
  - Add ground beef to tomato sauce and simmer on low heat from 30-60 minutes.
  - NOTE - At this point, you can slow cook sauce for as long as a few hours prior to serving.
  - If adding bacon, chop bacon and cook in skillet until crispy. Add to sauce just before serving.
