  - a.k.a. sloppy chicken delight in my mouthole (by Amy)
  - This recipe is great for InstantPots, Ninja Foodi, or any other pressure cooker. You could also try modifying it for a slow cooker recipe if you don't have a pressure cooker!
  - I, personally, am not a ranch fan, so I altered the seasoning from the original author's recipe. You're welcome to follow the recipe as provided in the link above if you do like ranch flavor.
  - Through trial and error, I've found that the best way to cook this recipe is using the pot-in-pot method. You're welcome to follow the recipe as outlined below, but I've found the original recipe to be slightly watery and messy. Using the pot-in-pot method, I add the water to the outer pot (so the cooker can get up to pressure) but use only the chicken, cream cheese, and seasoning in the inner pot. The chicken tends to release moisture while it cooks (especially if you forget to thaw your chicken, which I have been guilty of on occasion), which gives the finished dish the perfect consistency.
ingredients:
  - 1/2 Cup water or low-sodium chicken broth
  - 2 lbs boneless, skinless, chicken breasts
  - 2 Tbsp rotissere chicken seasoning
  - 8 oz cream cheese, room temperature and cut into chunks
  - 1 Cup freshly shredded cheddar cheese
  - 8 slices thick-cut bacon, chopped
  - (optional) 3 green onions, chopped
  - salt, to taste
instructions:
  - Add water/broth to inner pot of pressure cooker. Add chicken to the pot in single layer, overlapping as little as possible.
  - Sprinkle seasoning over chicken and add cream cheese into the pot, dotting evenly along chicken.
  - Close pressure cooker lid and cook for 12 minutes on high pressure. (This timing will vary based on the thickness of your chicken breasts, increase up to 20 minutes for larger/thicker breasts.)
  - Once cooking is complete, leave to naturally release pressure for 10 minutes, then turn the release knob to "Vent" to quick-release remaining pressure.
  - Once depressurized, remove breasts and shred using 2 forks to maintain thicker pieces of chicken.
  - Whisk the remaining cream cheese mixture until evenly combined, then add cheese to melt.
  - Add shredded chicken back into pot, mix until chicken is evenly coated in cheese mixture.
  - Add bacon and green onions, mix to combine
  - Serve on toasted buns, or over pasta or rice.
