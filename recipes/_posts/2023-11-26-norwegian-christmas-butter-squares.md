ingredients:
  - 1 cup butter, softened
  - 1 egg
  - 1 cup sugar
  - 1 c flour
  - 1 tsp vanilla extract
  - 1/2 tsp salt

instructions:
  - Chill a 9x13" pan in the freezer - do not grease.
  - Using a mixer, combine butter, egg, sugar, and salt together until creamy. Add vanilla and flour, using your hands to combine until it holds together in large clumps. If it feels overly soft, add extra flour in small increments.
  - Using your hands, press the dough into the chilled pan until evenly around 1/4" thick. Dust the top evenly with turbinado sugar.
  - Bake at 400 F until edges turn golden, around 12-15 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before cutting into bars.
