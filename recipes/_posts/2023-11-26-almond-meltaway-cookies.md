title: Almond Meltaway Cookies
date: "2023-11-26"
words_of_wisdom:
  - Since the icing contains dairy, keep your almond meltaway cookies stored airtight in the fridge. They’ll keep for up to 2 weeks! Just take the cookies out of the fridge to come to room temperature again before serving.

ingredients_section_one:
  - 2 cups all-purpose flour
  - 1/2 tsp baking powder
  - 1/4 tsp salt
  - 1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
  - 3/4 cup granulated sugar
  - 1 large egg
  - 2 tsp almond extract
ingredients_section_two_name: For the Almond Icing&#58;
ingredients_section_two:
  - 1 cup powdered sugar
  - 1 to 2 tbsp milk, or sub water
  - 1 tsp almond extract
instructions:
  - Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silpat. Set aside.
  - In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
  - In a stand mixer, beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add egg and almond extract, mixing until combined. Add flour mixture 1/2 cup at a time, mixing until completely combined.
  - Roll 1 tablespoon of dough into small circles and then press with hands (or with the bottom of a cup) into a disk shape. Place on prepared baking sheet.
  - Bake for 8 minutes. The cookies will not look browned or cooked, but they are! Remove from oven and let cookies rest on baking sheet for 5 minutes. Then, transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
  - To Ice: In a small bowl, whisk together powdered sugar, 1 tablespoon milk and almond extract – until smooth. If your icing is too thick, add a splash more milk to thin it out.
  - Using a spoon, smooth icing onto the top of each cookie and let set for 10 minutes, or until hardened. Store in the fridge, let come to room temperature when ready to serve.
