date: "2022-07-02"
ingredients:
  - 1 boneless turkey breast, approx 3 lbs, frozen
  - 1 Cup water
  - 2 Tbsp melted butter
  - 1 Tbsp garlic and herb seasoning, plus more to taste
instructions:
  - Place roasting rack in the pressure cooker and add water.
  - Season the breast evenly along the top and place turkey on the rack, skin side up. Pressure cook on high for 45 minutes.
  - Once complete, allow to naturally release for 10 minutes, then turn the knob to quick release. NOTE - Check the temperature once pressure has released. Depending on how thawed/frozen your turkey was going in, it might need more or less time. We will continue to cook the turkey for a little longer in the air fryer in the next step, but it has to be 165°F to serve safely! If you feel it won't be up to temp after the next step, you can use the pressure cooking setting again in 5 minute intervals until it's closer.
  - Brush the turkey with melted butter, sprinkle additional seasoning over the turkey if desired, then cook on the airfry setting at 400° for an additional 6-8 minutes or until golden brown.
  - Lift rack from the Foodi and let rest for 5 minutes before carving and serving.
