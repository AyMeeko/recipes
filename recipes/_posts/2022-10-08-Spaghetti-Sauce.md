words_of_wisdom:
  - This recipe is HUGE! I almost always halve this recipe for the two of us and it is a very generous 4 portions. Whether or not you halve it, be sure to overestimate the size of the dish you assemble the lasagna into, rather than underestimate. (This is mostly a note for myself because I always get to the end and have more sauce leftover than what I can fit in my pan.)
  - I usually make my own sauce, which you can find the reicpe for here (remember to put link in to recipe once it's up and if you're reading this and you're not Amy or Lorea pretend you don't see this), but it's absolutely not a requirement. Feel free to use your favorite store bought sauce to save some time and labor.
  - One thing that a lot of people forget when making lasagna is to season your ricotta mixture. Ricotta on its own does not have a strong flavor, so salt ad pepper are a must (but I usually add a dash of garlic powder as well).
instructions:
  - Preheat oven to 375°. In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta according to package directions until al dente, less 2 minutes. Drain and drizzle a bit of olive oil to prevent noodles from sticking together. Lay noodles out flat on a parchment covered cookie sheet for easier handling later.
  - Add oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Brown the ground beef, then remove from heat and drain fat. Return beef to skillet, add garlic and oregano,then cook over medium heat, continually stirring for 1 minute or until herbs are fragrant. Season with salt and pepper, then add sauce and stir until warmed through.
  - Combine ricotta, 1/4 cup Parmesan, parsley, and egg in a large mixing bowl and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
  - In a large casserole dish, evenly spread a quarter of the meat sauce across the bottom of the dish. In this order, add a single layer of lasagna noodles, a layer of ricotta mixture, a single layer of mozzarella, and a layer of sauce. Repeat layers, topping the last layer of noodles with meat sauce, Parmesan, and mozzarella.
  - Cover with foil and bake for 15 minutes, then increase temperature to 400° and bake uncovered for 18 to 20 minutes.
  - Garnish with parsley before serving.
